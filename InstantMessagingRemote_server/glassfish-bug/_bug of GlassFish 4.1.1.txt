Due to a bug of GlassFish 4.1.1. you have to go to the directory where you have
the GlassFish 4.1.1 installed and access to the subfolder: "glassfish-4.1.1\glassfish\modules"
to:

- add the file: jackson-module-jaxb-annotations-2.5.1.jar
- replace the file: org.eclipse.persistence.moxy.jar

Create a new App Server and domain on NetBeans for the changes to take effect.
